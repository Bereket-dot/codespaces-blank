Game Description

The Number Sliding Game consists of a grid, usually 3x3 or 4x4, with one empty space. The tiles are numbered from 1 to N-1 (where N is the total number of tiles), and your goal is to slide the numbered tiles around the grid to arrange them in order from 1 to N-1, with the empty space at the end.

Example (3x3 grid):
1 | 2 | 3
4 | 5 | 6
7 | 8 |  _
The game starts with tiles in a scrambled order, and the player must slide the tiles into the correct order by moving them into the empty space.
